Echo:
command => 'echo'
*       => * (entire packet will get echoed back)

Dump:
command => 'dump' (this is all that needs to be sent as a request, rest is reply)
dump    => { massive hash structure of package status }

Update:
command => 'update'
type    => 'package'
package =>   state   => 'done' || 'fail' || 'release'
             arch    => 'armv5' || 'armv7'
             package => 'package name'

command => 'update'
type    => 'builder'
builder =>   name    => 'name'
             state   => 'idle' || 'building' || 'disconnect'
             arch    => 'armv5' || 'armv7' (if state == building)
             package => 'package name' (if state == building)

examples:
{ command => 'update', type => 'package', package => { state => 'done', arch => 'armv5', package => 'coreutils' } }

{ command => 'update', type => 'builder', builder => { name => 'platinum', state => 'idle' } }
{ command => 'update', type => 'builder', builder => { name => 'platinum', state => 'building', arch => 'armv7', package => 'coreutils' } }

notes:
- builder disconnect notice should remove builder from the display
- builder idle/building can also serve as a connect notice, should the builder not be already on the board
- type release on a package means building was terminated, package should be changed in display (if implemented) from building to not-built for specified architecture
